WebGL based viewer for Kepler orbits described by two-line element sets (TLEs).

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/sqaxomonophonen/satellite/master/media/screenshot.jpg)

Go download some `.txt` (TLE) files from  http://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/master.asp, then run `mangler.py` on them to generate a new data set (it will overwrite `data0.js`)

I place the code in the public domain. The texture map (earth.jpg) is also public domain - it comes from my other repository: https://github.com/sqaxomonophonen/worldmapsvg. I don't know about `data0.js` - CelesTrak does not mention any license conditions.

Have fun!
